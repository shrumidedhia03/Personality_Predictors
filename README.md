# Personality_Predictors
Personality Predictors is a machine learning-based project designed to predict an individual's personality type using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). This project has been presented and published at the IEEE 2nd Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology.

The key highlights of this project include:

Classification of 8000 Rows: Our team meticulously classified a dataset containing 8000 rows of data into 16 distinct personality types based on the MBTI framework. This extensive data collection forms the foundation of our predictive model.
BERT Base Model: We leveraged the power of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) base model in Python to create a robust predictive tool. BERT's natural language processing capabilities allow for nuanced and accurate personality predictions.

## Important Note: Please be aware that this project may require elevated access permissions. This is due to changes in the API used by X (formerly known as Twitter). The project was initially developed with API v1.1, but now, X uses API v2. Therefore, to access and utilize the latest data from X, it may be necessary to update your access permissions accordingly.

This project aims to provide valuable insights into personality prediction using modern machine learning techniques. Whether you're interested in understanding personality types or seeking a practical application for personality prediction, Personality Predictors offers a robust and insightful solution.

Feel free to explore our research paper and the project itself to gain a deeper understanding of personality prediction.
